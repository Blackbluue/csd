Now that you're ready to begin, download "genFileDir.sh" and "modFiles.sh" to begin.

"genFileDir.sh" will fill your directory with an assortment of files. Your job is to find all files
 with extensions of .tyt, .wqr, and .rtl then read their contents to retreive an encoded string. 
 You must log the valid filenames, the contents of the valid files, then the decoded contents to a file. 
 Then generate a second report that includes the name of the non-valid files with their contents. 
 Check the README for requirements and examples of what the outputs should look like.
 
To clean up the directory, run modFiles.sh

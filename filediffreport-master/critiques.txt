1. There seems to be an issue with formatting in genFileDir.sh, which cause errors
2. genFileDir.sh must be run with sudo permissions in order to chmod files
3. As the files are generated randomly, there is no way to tell in what order to
   read the files. So the contents of the files cannot be decoded since there
   is no way to tell the order of the messages
